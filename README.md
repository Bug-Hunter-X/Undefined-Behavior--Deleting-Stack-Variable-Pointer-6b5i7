This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: attempting to delete a pointer to a stack variable. The code sample shows the incorrect usage, and a solution is provided that avoids the undefined behavior.  This error can lead to program crashes, memory corruption, or other unpredictable results. Understanding the difference between stack and heap allocation is crucial for writing correct and stable C++ code.  The solution explains the correct method of allocating memory using new and deleting it using delete to prevent this common error.
